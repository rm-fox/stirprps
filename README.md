# GRx

For this demonstration of the idea, I built the backend via Solana for several reasons:
- Ethena recently has integrated with the network via a solana version of USDe. Thus I want to aid expansion here.
- From my experience Solana offers a better experience for trading, due to its speed and small gas fees, however I am open to building on any protocol.

# React + TypeScript + Vite
